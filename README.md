# Health_Assistant
Project health assistant

Detailed Description :

The provided script is a simple voice-controlled assistant implemented in Python. Let's break down the key functionalities and features:

1. **Imported Libraries:**
    - The script imports several Python libraries, including **`pyttsx3`** for text-to-speech synthesis, **`speech_recognition`** for recognizing speech, **`datetime`** for handling date and time, **`wikipedia`** for fetching information from Wikipedia, **`webbrowser`** for opening web pages, **`os`** for interacting with the operating system, and **`smtplib`** for sending emails.
2. **Text-to-Speech Initialization:**
    - The **`pyttsx3`** library is initialized to convert text into spoken words.
3. **Greeting Function:**
    - The **`wishMe`** function greets the user based on the current time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening).
4. **Speech Recognition Function:**
    - The **`takeCommand`** function uses the **`speech_recognition`** library to capture audio input from the user's microphone, convert it to text using Google's speech recognition service, and return the recognized query.
5. **Email Sending Function:**
    - The **`sendEmail`** function configures and sends an email using the **`smtplib`** library. It requires the user's Gmail credentials (email and password).
6. **Main Loop:**
    - The script enters an infinite loop where it continuously listens for user commands.
7. **Command Execution:**
    - The script recognizes specific commands, such as:
        - "Wikipedia" to search and read a summary from Wikipedia.
        - "Open YouTube," "Open Google," "Open Stack Overflow" to open respective websites in a web browser.
        - "The time" to get the current time.
        - "Open Code" to open the provided file (**`wellness_assistant.py`**) in the default code editor.
        - "Email to Tanvi" to send an email to the specified email address (**`tanviofficial17@gmail.com`**).
8. **Additional Functionality:**
    - There are commented-out sections related to playing music, but they are currently not implemented.
    - There's an option to fetch and speak a health tip using the **`get_health_tip`** function.
    - There's a medication reminder using the **`remind_medication`** function.
9. **Exit Command:**
    - The script can be terminated by saying "Quit," "Bye," or "Goodbye," which triggers a farewell message before exiting the program.

It's worth noting that the script contains hardcoded email credentials and paths. In a production environment, it's crucial to handle such sensitive information securely. Additionally, further improvements and error handling could be added to enhance the robustness of the assistant.
